# Stanford CS193p-2021 SwiftUI - Solutions


These are the solutions to the assingments from CS193p-2021 taught by [Paul Anthony Hegarty](https://profiles.stanford.edu/paul-hegarty) 

The solutions of-course are not optimals as i'm learning [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/) aswell. 

I have included the code that is written during the lecutres and the code that we are supposed to write for the assingment. 

## Code

1. Lecture 1 
    - [Lecture Code](https://github.com/OneUpWallStreet/Stanford-CS193p-2021-Solutions/tree/master/Lecture%201)

    - [Assignment 1 Code](https://github.com/OneUpWallStreet/Stanford-CS193p-2021-Solutions/tree/master/Lectures%202%2C3%2C4/Assignment%20Code)

If you looked at the code you can probably tell that im not a Stanford student lol. I was able to attend the course becuase they made it available for free! 

Visit [CS193p's webiste](https://cs193p.sites.stanford.edu)  for all the details, there you can find all the lecutres, programming assignments and also reading material for learning/understanding swift.

## CheckList

- [ ] Complete All Asssignments 
- [ ] Write Good Code
- [ ] Finish All The Reading Material.
- [ ] Watch All The Lectures.

 

## Extra Links

You should defiantly also check out some of the [official SwiftUI documentaion](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui) and the [tutorials](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui/creating-and-combining-views).

Also check out how Swift works [Apple's documentation](https://swift.org/documentation/) on that is awesome. 



Thank You [Stanford](https://www.stanford.edu)!
